      <h2 style="color: deeppink;">Hunt for Water</h2>
      <p style="color: black;"> - Here our goal was to create an engaging video that allows the viewer to follow the journey of the young man in desperate need of water creating a comedic and empathetic experience. After looking at the assignment prompt we decided to take inspiration from option 4 which was to ‘tell a story that mixes video shot at different locations into a cohesive whole’. The overall concept of the video revolves around the theme of adversity and obstacles. The man's basic need (his thirst) and the lack of water resemble the obstacle. This was then followed by adversity and misfortune as the man didn’t have water in his dorm and was encountered by various people. As mentioned earlier, we wanted to create a sense of empathy for the viewers through the hurdles he had to face which overall may have created a feeling of frustration and perhaps humor.
       
         <br>  </br>-Our team created a compelling video piece, starting with a carefully crafted script that effectively conveyed our message. We filmed using a Blackmagic camera and H5 Zoom recorder, capturing a range of shots and sounds to immerse viewers in the character's emotions and environment. Post-production involved fine-tuning visuals and audio in Adobe Premiere Pro, addressing issues like lighting conditions and audio volume variations. We meticulously synchronized the audio and visuals, and added captions for clarity.
        The film's cinematic introduction was designed in Adobe After Effects, leveraging online tutorials and templates. To showcase the video, we developed an interactive website featuring a thematic water video background. The site offers multiple user interactions, including a navigation bar for easy access to various sections, and a cup graphic that fills with water as users scroll, mirroring the character's journey. The site also hosts a gallery of behind-the-scenes photos from the film's production.
