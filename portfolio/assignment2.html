      <h2 style="color: deeppink;">Boredom to Adventure</h2>
      <p style="color: black;"> -"BOREDOM TO ADVENTURE: A CHOOSE-YOUR-OWN JOURNEY THROUGH TIME" is an interactive "choose your own story" comic, 
        coded and designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This comic is the story of a kid who was unhappy with his life and embarks on a trip through different eras and futures as he goes from the dinosaur era to the Jazz Age of the 1920s,  to an ultramodern futuristic city to a dystopian nuclear future - ultimately leading the character to realize that his everyday life is not so bad as he initially thought. The central theme revolves around embracing one's present life and finding joy and excitement within it. The comic seeks to engage users not just as passive recipients of a story, but as active participants shaping their narrative.The experience is designed to be immersive with the audios that were used and the user interactivity. 

        <br>  </br> -The development of the project was a step-by-step process that started with brainstorming the storyline. 
        We all sat down together and brainstormed and wrote down the storyline and a vague sketch of each panel. Then Sunny and I collected the images from the web and she edited them on Adobe photoshop. Then, I collected all the sounds and edited them on Audacity. Then we broke down the code and each took a part to make the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to structure,
        style and make the pages interactive.
