      <h2 style="color: deeppink;">Journey Through the Forest</h2> 
      <p style="color: black;"> -In the immersive website experience "Journey Through the Forest", users navigate forest scenes during various times of day, enhancing their virtual journey with thematic background music. Each scene is equipped with play, pause, and volume control buttons to regulate the audio. The scenes gradually zoom in for a sense of forward movement, and the journey concludes with an exit scene. The user can then choose to restart their voyage, allowing for exploration at their own pace.     
      
      <br>  </br>-We implemented this process by dividing up the pieces of the project. The sound piece draws inspiration from different audio elements to create a rich and dynamic storytelling experience. It incorporates natural sounds and site-specific recordings using an NTG-2 microphone and a Zoom H5n recorder intertwined in Audacity to evoke a sense of presence and exploration. By combining these elements, the piece guides listeners through a journey with a distinct beginning, middle, and end, offering a cohesive and engaging narrative structure. Three of the group members worked on each audio piece for the morning, afternoon, and night. The website was coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One group member worked mainly on the webiste layout, and then we all collaborated on features of the website such as the zoom feature, volume control, and other buttons.
      
      <br>  </br>-Sound Library: All sounds used were downloaded from “FreeSound.org” or recorded on campus (water sounds, walking on leaves, birds chirping)
