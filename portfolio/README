Project Description:
This portfolio is a personal project that aims to demonstrate my skills and experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python, and Unity. 
The overall theme is a journey, where visitors embark on a virtual flight to explore my work and know more about me. 
I have aimed to create an engaging and interactive experience, where each destination on the map represents a different aspect of my portfolio.

Process:
The implementation of this concept involved the use of various technologies and principles. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface.
The interface design reflects the theme of a journey, with a plane icon moving to different destinations on a world map.

Reflection/Evaluation:
Looking back, I am pleased with how this project has turned out. The initial goal was to create a portfolio that was not only informative 
but also interactive and engaging. I believe I have achieved this.

The process of developing this project has allowed me to apply and showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

There were challenges along the way, particularly in making the interactive map work smoothly.
However, overcoming these obstacles has only led to a better end product and has helped me grow as a developer.
In the future, I plan to continue updating and hope to add my other projects that i've done and aren't related to this class and to
improve this portfolio as I work on more projects and gain more skills. This portfolio is more than just a showcase of my past work; 
it's a reflection of my journey as a developer.
